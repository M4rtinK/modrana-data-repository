## ** modRana data repository configuration file ** ##
## -> optimized for low resource usage <-
## NOTE: for full option documentation, see the main repository.conf file

## ** Folders ** ##

temporary_folder=temp
repository_folder=results

## * Queue & Processing pool sizes * ##
cpu_count=1

## Default value for all queues used during repository update
queue_size=1

source_queue_size=1
packaging_queue_size=1
publish_queue_size=1
processing_pool_size=1
packaging_pool_size=1

## * Monav * ##

## You can use the following variable to set path to the
## Monav preprocessor binary
#monav_preprocessor_path=/usr/bin/monav-preprocessor

monav_parallel_threads=1
#monav_parallel_threshold=200
monav_preprocessor_threads=2

## * How many resources should the repository need with this config ?
## -> up to 4 packages can be processed at once
## (1 being downloaded, 1 being processed, 1 being packaged # 1 being published)
## -> but as processing & download mostly takes more time than other stages,
## just 2 packages will usually be in progress at the same time
## -> only one package can be in the memory hungry processing stage at once
## -> if you are just memory limited but have enough storage space, consider increasing the
## source_queue_size so that multiple packages can be downloaded & queued
